# DAY5
We've learned the following cool stuff.

- more code review to know other people's coding skills.
- deploy website via gitHub page.  This is my favorite part. It is exciting to see my website go alive!
- continue learning more about functions in javascrpt. I like the assignments which let me familiar with
  how to use array in functions. I like it.
finishing the final touch of the webpage is a little challenging for me. I spent most of my time on it. Because I did not learn any HTML and CSS before.  The most difficult part I found is to properly design the layout and remember the parenthesis of the selectors.
