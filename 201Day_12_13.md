# DAY12-14
It is the most challenging week.  The assignment needs us to internalize all the stuff we've learned and raise it to the next level.  At this point, I'm not so familiar with complicated data structure. The best approach for this week's assignment is to use an array with multiple objects. I ended up use arrays to finish the first two parts today. It took so much time. It is the first time that I feel I'm losing my enthusiasm. Anyway, I start to feel good again after I finished it eventually. Thanks for the TAs to help troubleshooting.

Here is what we learned today
- code review
- generate charts based on collected data and display on the webpage
  * how to use html5's canvas tag and a javaScript plugin Chart.js
- local storage
  * understand the difference between local storage, session storage and cookie.
