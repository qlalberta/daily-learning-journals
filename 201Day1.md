# DAY 1
The first day went fast.  The content is relatively easy.  The people I'm working with are great.
Most of what I've learned is listed as follows:
 - Atom editor
 - terminal
 - basic structure of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
 - how to integrate different layers of HTML, CSS and Javascript (this is the best part I liked today)
