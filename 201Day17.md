# DAY 17


Today, we plan to do styling and stretch goal at the same time. I worked with Jose on the data structure today. Tyler and Alana worked styling. In late afternoon, we all worked on styling individually to speed up finishing the MVP.  I feel I'm now a little connected with the slot machine idea after seeing the animation effect.  

We are getting better to work with each other. But because of lacking communication on the first day, I wasted some time to do work that the rest of group does not want to include.  I feel a little frustrated.  

Anyway, we are keeping making great progress.  I hope we can finish styling quickly tomorrow and test it ASAP.
I like the idea that Stephanie suggested.  To write a test program and test the product with MVP and along with the work on the stretch goal.
