# DAY 17


Today, we plan to do styling and stretch goal at the same time. I worked with Jose on the data structure today. Tyler and Alana worked styling. In late afternoon, we all worked on styling individually to speed up finishing the MVP.  

We are keeping making great progress.  I hope we can finish styling quickly tomorrow and test it ASAP.
