# DAY 18


Today, I worked more on CSS styling and displaying the moneyBalance of the current user.  I also worked with Jose to add differentGameLevel. It was fun to create a drop-down list and figure out how to get the value from a drop-down list and trigger the onchange event to render the response we want.

We finished more stretch goals. Other team member added fancy features to the slot machine. The product looks great but no one is interested in testing.  There are still some bugs. I'm interested in writing some unit test procedures as suggested.  But I don't have a clue where to start at this point.

I hope we will spend more time on testing tomorrow instead of stretch goals.
