# DAY 16
- Planning
  * We removed the part of using as a therapeutic tool since it may need an additional stats page.
  I still wish we could include this part, though.  
  * came out the user stores and technical requirements

- Coding
I worked with Alana on the game logic today. Tyler and Jose worked on the persistance. Our team is fast-paced. On the first day, we've already finished the game logic and persistance. But some of them are too fast and I feel there not enough communications between everyone.

Anyway, I'm glad we are taking actions quickly. Also, they accepted my suggestion to slow down and make sure everyone will be on the same page tomorrow.
