# DAY_14_15
We've learned about CSS transform, transition and animation on day14. The basic technique is not difficult. But I think the key is to know when to use it and how to use it in an appropriate way. It is not all about technical skills.

We also started preparing our project. Our team picked up a project named "Alexithymia slot machine game". It can let us use all the skills we've learned at an appropriate level.  I'm not a fan of the idea of promoting people playing video games. But eventually, we modified the idea by using emoji as the image for players to click. In this case, it can be a therapeutic tool for people suffering alexithyma. I'm glad it seems we are all enjoyed the discussions.  I'm looking forward to the next week.
