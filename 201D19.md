# DAY 19


Today, I worked on displaying the rank of all users based on their on-time moneyBalance on stat page.  I also worked with Alana for displaying on-time balance and more styling on the game page.  We also did presentation testing and modified styles based on the visual effect.  We came out the flow to introduce the team and game and ready for practice tomorrow morning.

During the process of sorting the array, I found that I cannot use sort to order the array element based on the numeric value. Finally I realized that it is because the flexibility of javascript, the number is treated as a string.

Anyway, I'm glad we finished testing by end of the day and ready for practice.
