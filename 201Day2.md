# DAY2
We've learned the following cool stuff.

- more HTML and CSS, particularly semantic tags of CSS
- use of mark-down for README.md file
- git workflow (This is the my favorite part today. There is a lot to digest, though. It sounds simple:
  add, commit and push, but it takes me some time to really understand these steps)
