# DAY3
We've learned the following cool stuff.

- box model of css
- loop in javascript
- the flexibility of javascript
- learn the concerpt of Minimum Viable Product (MVP). How to come up specific techinical requirement based on user stories.
- code review (this is my favorite part. Through this process, I got familar with more terminology and different ways to finish the same task)

I really like the instructor compares different languages.  Also, she is not teaching techinical skills, also she mentioned the importance of teamwork in industry.  Sometimes, it is more important to deliver the result based on the team requirement.
