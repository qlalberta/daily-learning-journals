# DAY 20

We did practice this morning and the presentation went well in the afternoon.
Our game looks good.

The structure of the presentation can be better though.  We should have had a
person to talk about technical issues. Other than that, we did a good job.

Also, it is good to talk though issues with Brian. So we know what we can do
better next time.
